Hello! This is my first project at all.

The main idea was: make a discord bot that can play music on voice channel.
Firstly, i made basis of my bot. Reaction on messages, reaction on commands.
Secondly, i made a moderation tools(mute users for bad words and etc.)
Also made a intercative statu, that changes after some time.
And finally, i jumped ahead to documetation(Ydl and ffmpeg), to make my bot "sing".

a couple of days later I finally made him sing but i made it as unprofessional as possible. 

Anyway, if u are keep reading it thankyou, you can try my bot BUT...

You need to register this bot by ur self on https://discord.com/developers/applications.
